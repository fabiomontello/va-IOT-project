# Visual Analytics - Smart home monitoring

### Visual Analytics - Smart home monitoring
Our project aims to help a common user in viewing and analyzing data related to their smart home. It contains time readings on different appliances in a house, combined with data on weather conditions. We will illustrate the graphs and techniques used to extract visual information from the data set, discussing the purpose of the methods we used and the choices we made.
